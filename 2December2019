Used Docker to load SQLSERVER
Used VS Code to connect to new sqlserver/docker
Want to load wideworldimporters tomorrow

Found a nasty delay ~20 seconds for many docker commands, maybe related to ip4 and ip6.
Possibly resolved by modifying network settings, but I don't want to do that just for a docker
